# StackBuddy.io 🚀

**Your AI-Powered Dev Lead for Smarter, Faster Codebases**

StackBuddy is a developer-first SaaS platform that analyzes your codebase, audits your tech stack, and recommends better tools, packages, and architecture decisions — just like a senior engineer would. Whether you're a solo dev, indie hacker, or early-stage startup, StackBuddy helps you build with confidence and modern best practices.

  Receive intelligent suggestions on how to upgrade or simplify your stack (e.g., “Switch from Axios to Fetch”, “Move to Prisma + PostgreSQL”).

- 🛠️ **AI Refactor Suggestions**

- 📄 **Auto-Generated Docs**  
  Instantly create README files, `.env.example`, onboarding instructions, and more.

  Ask your codebase anything: "Where is the auth token handled?" or "What version of Tailwind is used?"
